xWhoops
=======

A XOOPS 2.6.0 extension that brings [whoops](https://github.com/filp/whoops) error display to XOOPS. It is especially handy for diagnosing failures brought on by unhandled errors, so you can more properly handle them.

Administrators will always have access to the extended diagnotics, and other groups can also be granted access.

Outside of the control panel, there is no user interface. It will "just work" when needed.

To add *xwhoops* to your XoopsCore use:
```
composer require geekwright/xwhoops
```
